  <p  class="info">Your voucher will arrive in your inbox in the next few minutes. If it doesn't appear, <span class="teal">check your spam folder</span>. If it's still missing in action give us a call during business hours on (07) 5446 8977</p>
      
      <p class="info">What a Spirit House gift voucher lacks in size and weight, it makes up for in unadulterated gastronomic fun and frivolity. The lucky recipient can use it in the <span class="teal">restaurant, cooking school</span>  as well as the Spirit House shop where they can buy cook books, cooking gadgets and ingredients.</p>
      
      <p class="info">When you give the voucher be sure to point out that it is valid for one year and that effectively this voucher is like front row tickets to their favourite sport or show ... so if they want to get in to the restaurant or a cooking class it pays to book EARLY. Send them to our website to book cooking classes online, check out the restaurant menu or find maps and places to stay.</p>

<p class="info">Once printed, simply fold along the 'fold marks' and you will have a double sided gift voucher. You can book cooking classes online with this voucher immediately and the voucher can also be used in the restaurant. Please read the fine print on the voucher for conditions.</p>
      

      
      <p class="info">Thanks again for your order and we promise to take great care of this lucky person,
      <br>
      <br>
      The Spirit House team.
      </p>
