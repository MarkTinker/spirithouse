			<p class="info">The tag-along concept is simple &mdash; make your own way to Bangkok, or Delhi, (use your frequent flyer miles if you have them), meet up with Spirit House staff and let us lead you on a fantastic journey of food, exploration and cultural history.</p>
			
			<p class="info">In 2017, two tours are scheduled: Thailand/Cambodia, plus a longer tour to India. Each has been hand-crafted by Spirit House to offer you not only the major cultural highlights, but eclectic side trips of tastes, sights and experiences most tourists never see. In short, our tours are unique. 
			</p>
			<p class="info"> Led by a Spirit House staff member and limited to just 8 people per tour, it's like travelling with a bunch of fun-loving friends.

			<P class="info">As we show you in the video above: what started out as a boutique tour focused on Thai food culture and heritage has become four amazing days to see a side of Thailand that most tourists never get to experience.</P>
			
			<P class="info">The great thing about this tour is you will return to Bangkok after visiting one of the great wonders of the world, Angkor Wat in Cambodia. So if you're planning a Thai holiday why not join us for the first few days first, come to Angkor Wat with us and return to Thailand to explore the rest of this fascinating country with all its amazing diversity.</P>
			
			   <div class="pullquote-left">"Tours are limited to 8 people."</div>
			<p class="info">The best part is you don't need to organise a thing - simply make your way to Bangkok and we will take care of you every step of the way after that.</p>

			<P class="info">The essential ingredients to enjoy our Tour?  Be adventurous about tasting new food.  Be flexible, as we sometimes alter the itinerary if interesting places attract your attention ... all part of the fun!

						<p>This trip is all about food and drink, mixed in with some history, culture and amazing sights along the way - with no stress or hassles. Your tour is hosted by Spirit House director, Acland Brierty, fluent in Thai and passionate about Thai food.   Featuring 4-5 star hotels, all internal flights, tours, meals and private bus, this tour is designed for those who want to see a different side of S.E. Asia, plus tick Angkor Wat off their 'bucket list' .</p>
						<p>Boats take us to the old city of Bangkok where we wander through the back streets tasting street food from vendors who have been making their specialties in the same location for many generations. A fascinating walk through Bangkok's largest fresh market,  then off to a cooking class in one of the city's teeming slums, which will give you an insight into life behind the Bangkok glitz - a fascinating morning and a highlight.</p>
						<p>At night, we change gears - experience some of Bangkok's best and eclectic dining experiences. Taste what the new breed of Thai chefs are doing with their traditional food. Equally exciting is the new generation of bartenders, who are creating some of the funkiest, most avant-garde spaces - we have chosen a few of the most innovative bars in town for after dinner drinks and a well deserved night-cap.
							
						<p>Sight seeing? We're off to Ayutthaya, a world heritage site of picturesque ruins, great food and a relaxed change in pace. The view from our boutique hotel will blow your mind.  And the best part?  It's just an hour's drive from Bangkok.
							
							<p>Temples, elephants bathing, food, drinks, silk weaving, boat trips, river life, ancient ruins and <span class='teal'>two miracles</span> -  this is a great introduction to a Thailand which most tourists rarely see.  To top it all off, we will duck over the border for the two nights and <span class='teal'>explore Angkor Wat in Cambodia.</span></p>
							
							
						
						
						<p><span class='teal'>In Summary:</span>in just over a week we will pack plenty of food, sights, sounds and adventure to make this a trip of a life time. All your accommodation, meals, transport and entrance fees are covered. The only extra is alcohol. See the Itinerary &amp; Costs section for a detailed breakdown of inclusions and the itinerary.</p>
						
						<p>And there's no reason to head home when you've finished your Spirit House tour.  When we arrive back in Bangkok, you could head south to a tropical island or fly north to the mountains of Chiang Mai - a perfect finish to your Thai adventure.</p>

						<h2>Costs &amp; Duration:</h2>
						<p>This 7 night / 8 day costs $2,350 per person (twin share). Limited to just 8 people, it allows more flexibility than a rigidly scheduled tour. Each group is hosted by Spirit House director, Acland Brierty. Acland speaks Thai and offers a very unique, local's guide to each destination.	
							
												
						<p>Each day usually finishes in the early afternoon. which allows plenty of free time before dinner to shop, sit by the pool, relax with a massage or visit some more cultural sights.</p>
						
						<h2>Brief Itinerary: </h2>
						<h2><span class='red'>Day&nbsp;<sup>#</sup>1:&nbsp;</span> </h2><p> This is actually the day you arrive in Bangkok so we have
							 nothing planned. If you arrive early we can meet up for drinks and get to know each other before the tour starts. 
							 You will make your own way to the Patumwan Princess, taxi is easy or you can have Zoe, our travel rep, organise a 
							 transfer for you if you like. The tour starts in the lobby of the Patumwan Princess at 9am the next morning.</p>
							<p><span class='teal'>Includes:</span>
							<br>Hotel Bangkok.

													
						<h2><span class='red'>Day&nbsp;<sup>#</sup>2:&nbsp;</span> </h2><p> Meet in the lobby of the Patumwan Princess at 9am, ready to go. Today we take a fascinating walking tour of old royal Bangkok, sample street food, visit Buddha factories and temples - a side of Bangkok most tourists don't see. Bring your camera, because we will start the tour by ferry, travelling to two of Bangkok's most revered temples and the King's Grand Palace.</p>
						<p><strong>Dinner -</strong> we're leaving tourist town and taking you to an upscale neighbourhood to a restaurant run by a team of talented chefs doing very interesting twists on Thai food.   Night Caps?  We'll make that decision after dinner!
						<p><span class='teal'>Includes:</span>
							<br>All meals.
							<br>Transportation fees, entrance fees.
							<br>Hotel Bangkok.
							
						</p>
						
						
						<h2><span class='red'>Day&nbsp;<sup>#</sup>3:&nbsp;</span></h2><p>A tour of Bangkok's biggest wet markets and then participate in a private cooking class in a city slum nearby. Don't worry, this cooking school is professionally run and gives you a glimpse into yet another side of Thai life - fascinating and fun. We'll finish the day at the home of Thai silk, Jim Thompson's house and for a special treat, we take you on a short walk to the private homes of traditional silk weavers where you can see the whole silk making process in action.</p>
						<p><strong>Dinner -</strong> Another favourite with our chefs and yet another restaurant well off the tourist map but very popular with the trendy Thai crowd. Drinks - let's slowly make our way back to the hotel visiting one or two very interesting bars on the way. One is so secret they forbid you for revealing their location.
						
						<p><span class='teal'>Includes:</span>
							<br>All meals.
							<br>All activities.
							<br>Hotel Bangkok.
							
						</p>
						
						<h2><span class='red'>Day&nbsp;<sup>#</sup>4:&nbsp;</span></h2><p> Pack your bags we're off to Ayutthaya. We'll explore 13th century ruins, ride an elephant, learn how to make Persian fairy floss by hand - afternoon free to explore more ruins, relax in the pool with a beer etc. That evening we're off to watch the elephants bathe in the river and dinner in the local market.</p>
						
						<p><span class='teal'>Includes:</span>
							<br>All meals.
							<br>All activities.
							<br>Hotel Ayutthaya.
							
						</p>
						
						<h2><span class='red'>Day&nbsp;<sup>#</sup>5:&nbsp;</span></h2><p> Early morning start to visit another fascinating ruin before heading to the river to take a long tail boat down to the King's old summer palace. We travel by rickety cable car to a bizarre neo-gothic style buddhist temple.</p>
						<p>We leave from here to the airport for our afternoon flight to Siem Reap and Angkor Wat. This evening will be spent soaking up the atmosphere in downtown Siem Reap and the famous night markets, shops and restaurants. </p>
						
						<p><span class='teal'>Includes:</span>
							<br>All meals.
							<br>All activities.
							<br>Flight to Siem Reap
							<br>Hotel Siem Reap.
							
						</p>
						
						<h2><span class='red'>Day&nbsp;<sup>#</sup>6:&nbsp;</span></h2><p>Today is temple day. Let's start early and take a trip through the temple areas, stopping off at the lesser known temples for exploring. Then at lunch time, right in the heat, we will visit Angkor Wat when the crowds are at their lowest.. Right next door is Angkor Thom, equally as beautiful and we will stop here in the forest for a tranquil break away from the crowds in a seldom visited area of the temple city complex.  </p>
						<p>Now that we're all 'templed out' and tired of the heat it's time to  head back to the hotel where you can chill out by the pool, have a massage and just relax. Around sunset we can head off to visit some other temples in the cool of the evening and then have a great dinner in town.</p>
						<p><span class='teal'>Includes:</span>
							<br>All meals.
							<br>All activities.
							<br>Hotel Siem Reap.
							
						</p>
						
						<h2><span class='red'>Day&nbsp;<sup>#</sup>7:&nbsp;</span></h2> <p>Off to see the temple made famous in the Tomb Raider movie. Back to the hotel and catch our early afternoon flight back to Bangkok. </p>
						
						<p>Afternoon:- arrive in Bangkok, check in to Patumwan Princess hotel. Spend the afternoon at leisure. Dinner at your expense.
							
						<p><span class='teal'>Includes:</span>
							<br>Breakfast and Lunch.
							<br>All activities.
							<br>Flight to Bangkok
							<br>Hotel Bangkok.
							
						</p>
						
						<h2><span class='red'>Day&nbsp;<sup>#</sup>8:&nbsp;</span></h2><p>End of tour. From here you can fly home or head off to the beaches and island in the south of Thailand or take in the hill tribes and more laid back lifestyle of Chiang Mai. </p>
						
							<p><span class='teal'>Includes:</span>
							<br>Breakfast.				
							
						</p>
						
						
						<h2>Put your wallet away:</h2>
						<p>Our tour is fully hosted by a Spirit House guide and we cover all food, transport, temple admissions etc. except for dinner on the night you arrive and the evening before you depart.</p>

						<div id="thai-tabs-flights" class="tabsection" style="display:none;">
							
							<h2>Flights:</h2>
							<p>Organise your own flights to Bangkok.   All other transport and return flights from Thailand to Cambodia are included. 							<p>(It's not because we're lazy that we don't include flights to Bangkok Ñ we know that many of you have frequent flyer miles and need the freedom to use rewards, points or memberships to reduce the cost of your flights.).</p>
							
							<h2>Visas:</h2>
							<p>You can collect a visa on arrival in Cambodia but you will need to take a passport photo with you and cash to pay for it. You can also go to the <a href="http://www.embassyofcambodia.org.nz/Visaregulation.htm"> Cambodian Embassy website, download the forms</a>	and follow the instructions to get your visa before you leave.	You can also get an <a href="https://www.evisa.gov.kh/"> eVisa for Cambodia</a> but we haven't tested that method yet.</p>
							<p>If you're an Australian citizen you don't need visas for Thailand.</p>
							
							
							<h2>Where you are staying:</h2>
<!--
							<p>
							Stay at the brand new <a href="http://litbangkok.com/" target="_blank">Lit Hotel</a> which is a bit closer to the action than the more popular <a href="http://www.siamatsiam.com/" target="_blank">Siam at Siam</a>. <a href="http://www.novotel.com/gb/hotel-1031-novotel-bangkok-on-siam-square/index.shtml"target="_blank">Novotel Siam</a> and <a href="http://pprincess.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Patumwan Princess</a> 
							are both a stone's throw from the major shopping action but <span class="teal"> all these hotels</span> are within easy walking distance of each other and close to our departure point - the Patumwan Princess Hotel.
							</p>
							
							<p>When you book your hotel keep in mind that for one night of the tour we're in Ayutthaya so you may want to <span class='teal'>check out</span> of your Bangkok hotel on <span class="red">Day <sup>#</sup>3 </span> of the tour and, 									depending on your onward travels, make a booking for when we return to Bangkok on <span class="red">Day <sup>#</sup>4</span>.
							
							-->
							
							<p>
							We've created a small map of the area around the hotel and all the places on the map are within walking distance of each other. We've also added helpful information on each place which you can see by clicking the map icons.</p>

							 <p>Our focus is on your safety and not letting India overwhelm you, so with that in mind we have selected a Delhi hotel which is close to upmarket shops, boutiques and restaurants and a short walk from a handicrafts market. In Agra, in keeping with our visit to the majestic Taj Mahal, we climb up a star to a more luxurious hotel.  In Rajasthan, we get a taste of living like a Maharaja in an ancient palace fort, while you will enjoy your very own overnight Hotel Marigold experience in Jaipur.

							<p> In short, our accommodation ranges from comfortable to luxury with the focus on being close to interesting places so you can explore safely on your own - after all, you didn't come to India to spend the day stuck in a hotel did you?
							
							<p> All entrance fees, guides, breakfast, lunch and most dinners are also covered The only extras will be dinner for the night of your arrival and when we return from Varanasi - otherwise, everything is covered.</p>

						<h2><span class='red'>Day&nbsp;<sup>#</sup>5:&nbsp;</span> </h2>
						<p> Let's get up early and head to the other side of the river and view the Taj at sunrise - a great way to start the day and no crowds. We do have a big day ahead so after the Taj it's back to the hotel, breakfast, pack bags and we're off to the heartland of Rajasthan's desert to the exotic city of Jaipur. We'll break the trip along the way, exploring the eerily abandoned desert city of Fatephur Sikri.
													
						<P>But it isn't only desert or ruins that will intrigue us. Our bus whizzes past villagers leading their camels,
							 local farmers in their mustard fields, pottery merchants selling their wares. The drive is very interesting in itself. Lunch is in a clean restaurant on the way with good toilets!
							  
							</P>
							

						
						<p><span class="teal"> Afternoon/Dinner</span> Ever wondered how the Maharajas lived? Wonder no more, because
							 tonight we are having our own "Hotel Marigold Experience", staying in one of their Havelis 
							 which has been converted into a boutique hotel. 
							 <p>The joy of being fabulously rich and having 
							 many wives is that your palace has many bedrooms, which is perfect if you ever decide to turn your house into a hotel!						
						<p>Dinner will be on the street as we visit some great bazaars and markets for shopping, sight-seeing and food.

							lunch in a magnificent fort. Very close to this fort is an ancient 'step well' known as a 'baoli'. These are inverted buildings that the Maharajas built to supply water to the region. This particular baoil is nine stories deep and an absolute feat of local architecture.

						<p> Today you fly home or head off to your next destination.							 
						</P>	
						
						<p><span class='teal'>Includes:</span>
							<br>Airport transfers
							<br>Breakfast							  							
						
						<h2>Put your wallet away:</h2>
						<p>We cover all hotels, transport, admissions and food where mentioned. There are a few nights which we have 
							left free for us to explore various restaurants at our own expense but you are more than welcome to 
							do your own thing. 
														
						</div>
						
						<div id="india-tabs-flights" class="tabsection" style="display:none;">
							
							<h2>Flights:</h2>
							<p>We don't offer flights because we know that many of you have frequent flyer miles which you want to use.
							<p>It is important that you arrive on Day One of the tour, so we can organise your airport transfers. If you wish to continue travelling in India, just book ongoing flights etc, after the last day of the tour.
								
								<h2>Costs &amp; Duration:</h2>
						<p>The 12day/11night tour costs $3,950 per person(twin share) - no single supplements available. Limited to just 8 
							people, this allows flexibility	to see and do much more than a rigidly scheduled tour. 
						
						<p>We usually finish each day by 3pm. which allows plenty of free time before dinner to shop, relax with a massage or visit some more cultural sights.</p>
						
						<h2>Visas:</h2>
						<p>You will need a visa for India. You can visit an Indian consular office in your city to apply and, in theory,
							you can apply online - but this is India and nothing is as straight forward as it seems. 
						
									
						<p>If you want to do your application in person then you will need to visit the 
							<a href="http://www.vfsglobal.com/india/australia/visa_services/tourist.html">VFS Global website</a> where you can 
							fill in your application form online and then book an appointment at a consular office to have the visa stamped in 
							your passport. You can also courier your visa to their office too. QUEENSLAND, please note there is a visa office in Brisbane but it is very important you put CANBERRA down in your form when it asks you which mission you are lodging your application.</p>
							
							<p>There is an <a href="https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/visa/tvoa.html">eVisa service</a> which means you apply online and pick up your visa on arrival at Delhi. You will need a photo of yourself against a white backdrop in jpeg format and a pdf file of your passport. The process is quite simple but make sure you print out your application when you've finished and take it with you on arrival at immigration in Delhi. They do love their paper work. Also, we've found that the eVisa can take longer at immigration at Delhi for some reason.</p>
														
						<p> Lastly, India likes to know where you're staying - at least when you arrive. Which will be as follows:
							The Hans Hotel,  15, Barakhamba Road, Connaught Place, New Delhi, Delhi 110001, India. Phone Number: +91 11 6615 0000.
						
						<h2>Health:</h2>
						<p>We have all heard about the dreaded Delhi Belly and having been to India a few times I haven't been sick. 
							Damien, our cooking school chef, was in India for 6 months eating locally and was never sick. 
							
							<p>In short
							we have chosen guides, restaurants and food experiences that are known for food safety and hygiene. But
							even with our food tours in Thailand, Laos, Vietnam while we do our best, we can't guarantee that you won't
							get a stomach bug, so please visit your doctor and pack a small medical kit that includes things like
							lomotil etc.
							
							<p>Also, a Hepatitis A shot never hurts when travelling in Asia so talk to your doctor about that too.
								
							<p>As in life, there are no guarantees. You can get sick eating at home or at a local restaurant, but 
									with good guides, common sense and a small medical kit you should be able to tackle the world.
