      <p class="info">Your voucher will arrive in a red presentation envelope together with our newsletter and a Spirit House brochure. If you have not received your voucher within 5 working days from ordering, please call our office on (07) 5446 8977.</p>
      
      <p class="info">What a Spirit House gift voucher lacks in size and weight, it makes up for in unadulterated gastronomic fun and frivolity. The lucky recipient  can use it in the <span class="teal"> restaurant, cooking school </span> as well as the Spirit House shop where they can buy cook books, cooking gadgets and ingredients.</p>
      
      <p class="info">When you give the voucher be sure to point out that it is valid for one year and that effectively this voucher is like front row tickets to their favourite sport or show ... so if they want to get in to the restaurant or a cooking class it pays to book EARLY. Send them to our website to book cooking classes online, check out the restaurant menu or find maps and places to stay.</p>
      
      <p class="info">Thanks again for your order and we promise to take great care of this lucky person,
      <br>
      <br>
      The Spirit House team.
      </p>
